## Mathematica Notebooks

Each notebook starts with a *Setup* section which must be evaulated first. Each setup section also contains a test (minimal usage example) for the provided functions.

*continuation-setup.nb* is a pure setup file that provides an functions and utils for pseudo-arclength continuation. It must remain in the same directory as *mesa-splitting_Brusselator.nb*, which loads it during setup. All other notebooks are independent.

## COMSOL

The COMSOL files contain no data. To run the simulations and export the data, COMSOL Version 5.4 is required.
